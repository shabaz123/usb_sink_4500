# usb_sink_4500

This repository contains a MicroPython project that can operate the STUSB4500-based USB Sink Click board, to control the output voltage from a USB-C Power Delivery source device such as a mobile phone charger.

WARNING: The code is experimental, it's not advised to make use of the output voltage without measuring it first!
